Don't bother listening to angry comments here on gradcafe talking bad about any particular top school for physics. UPenn's Physics attrition rate is relatively low compared to other schools, indicating student satisfaction. In general, most top places have funding. A particular group might be tight on money due to accepting too many students or a grant not getting approved, but I would assume it's rare as professors at most places generally only accept students if they think they would be able to fund the student. The suggestion that all/most of the groups are underfunded at any top place is a joke. Also, UPenn already had their Open House and sent out their initial acceptances. I am guessing they are waiting for those people to accept or decline before sending out the rest of the decisions. Good luck to all. In general, just visit the places you get accepted to and ask the professors about funding and all of that. They will usually tell you their situation and if they plan to take/fund new students."

I also have a question: as an international applicant (outside EU), I am wondering about the funding system. They said it is extremely hard for the international students to get funding from Oxford.

Brown University,Physics,Masters (F18),Other, Other,11 Apr 2018,,,,,,A,14 Apr 2018,"To the poster (from March 29) who said that if I had any other offer I should take it, could you please elaborate on that? Is the atmophere at the department hostile towards their ScM students? Also, is it worth it to go so much into debt to attain the ScM degree at Brown? From the interactions I've had with the department I have been told that there is no funding whatsoever for their ScM students, apparently they can't even pay ScM students from federal research grants. My main goal is to obtain a PhD, but sadly I have been rejected from every program I applied to, except Brown. Although having the ScM from Brown would look impressive on a future grad school application, will it be worth it considering all the money it entails? Not to mention that I live in the west coast and would have to move all the way across the country in order to attend Brown. Any input on my predicament would be greatly appreciated (especially from current ScM/PhD students)!"

I didn't apply to the Physics Department, but I believe it's similar for all DPhil programs: each department/graduate school has its own graduate admissions committee, and they are the people interviewing you and making the final decision. However, one of the factors influencing the final decision is whether you have a suitable supervisor or not, i.e. you cannot usually be admitted to the program without a supervisor having approved you to work in their lab. So the supervisors will likely feedback to your first interview panel and then the panel makes the final decision. Good luck!"

Whether your research interest matches with their groups is also important. For hep-th, I know several people (A/U) with several publications were rejected almost everywhere this year.

Your application has been carefully reviewed by the Graduate Admissions Committee of the Physics graduate program and by the Office of Graduate Studies. I regret to inform you that your application for graduate study at UC Davis for Fall Quarter 2014 was not approved.

Each year, the number of highly qualified applicants far exceeds the available openings in our graduate programs. For this reason, graduate programs must be very selective in making their admission decisions. Each decision is based on a comprehensive review of the applicant's file. Some of the factors taken into consideration include: prior academic record and preparation for advanced study in the selected field; examination scores and other submitted materials; completion of program admissions requirements including prerequisite coursework; ability of the program to provide curricular and/or research opportunities consistent with the applicant's stated educational objectives; and completeness of the applicant's file.

The program to which you applied indicated the following as the reason(s) that you were not selected for admission:
Academic work is not as competitive as that of other applicants.
If you have any questions regarding the reasons for your denial, you may contact the admissions adviser of the Physics graduate program. Thank you once again for your interest in pursuing graduate education at UC Davis. If in the future you believe that your accomplishments may be competitive, please do not hesitate to reapply. I wish you every success in achieving your educational objectives.

California Institute Of Technology (Caltech),Applied Physics,PhD (F12),Rejected, E-mail,27 Mar 2012,,,,,,I,27 Mar 2012,"Thank you very much for your application to the graduate program at the California Institute of Technology. After carefully reviewing your application, the faculty has decided that they are unable to grant you admission for academic year 2012 Ã¢ÂÂ 13. 

Since World is a relatively small space with respect to space, we are able to admit only a small percentage of the thousands of applicants who apply each year. 

In many cases we are unable to offer admission to highly qualified aliens, dark lords and cylons because, you know, we do not know if space is unlimited or not. 

You are just like others, we mean meteors, therefore, we can not admit you. We wish you the best of luck and hope that a death star won't hit you.

Best Regards,

In your response to your query, we have made our decisions and letters are going out.  Unfortunately we were unable to make you an offer.  This year things are extremely competitive: we had over 700 applicants for a class of approximately 30.  Given this reality,  we were unable to offer admission to many very highly qualified candidates and despite your very strong record we can not offer you admission to our program.
 
We thank you for your interest in Physics at the University of Maryland and we wish you much success in all your future endeavors.

Linda O'Hara"

number of openings.  As a result, we have been forced to decline a high 
percentage of excellent candidates such as yourself. 

I would also like to inform you of another graduate program in Applied 
and Engineering Physics which might be suitable for your career 
objectives.  This is the Master of Engineering program leading to the 
Master of Engineering Physics  professional degree.  The intent of this 
program is to build a specific area of technical expertise beyond the 
undergraduate degree.   However, there is *no *financial support for 
this program.

While most of our graduates from this program go on directly to 
employment, some find this program a very good preparation in qualifying

Now after the long and arduous process of prepping for GREs, courting professors through undergraduate and master's programs, and sweating over whether or not I'll make that nebulous cusp from A- to A, I can spend six more glorious years killing my eyesight in an asbestos-ridden library cut off from friends and sunlight, at the end of which may or may not be a quasi-proper job in a location over which I'll have little-to-absolutely-no say and where I'll hopefully spend the next seven to thirty years agonizingly demurring to colleagues who reflect my own pretentiousness (while at the same time caught in a pitiful, vicious circle of avoiding my family who has become resentful of my working 80 hours a week) and to students I'm sucking up to who will likely not even have the decency to appreciate the subject I've offered my soul to or let alone leave me the positive reviews essential for the tenure committee's approving that Full Professorship I will never get!"

Your application for admission to the Ph.D. program in the Department of English at Stanford University has been carefully reviewed. I regret to inform you that the department is not able to admit you to the program. As you may know, our program is an extremely small one, with a typical incoming cohort of only 6-8 students. There are thus a great many more qualified candidates than available positions, making our task especially onerous. I can assure you that these are very difficult decisions, and the entire faculty approaches the process with extraordinary care and consideration. We regret that due to restricted resources it is not possible to provide applicants with an individual response regarding admission. I wish that the Admissions Committee had happier news to convey. We very much appreciate your interest in Stanford University and wish you all the best for the future."

I write now to inform you that you have been placed on a short waitlist for admittance to our program.

 

We received a large number of excellent applications this yearÃ¢ÂÂfar more than we are able to accept, given our interest in maintaining a fully funded program.  We reviewed each application carefully, paying particular attention to each candidateÃ¢ÂÂs research statement, writing sample, previous academic record, and relevant professional activities.  We then compared each application with applications that fell within the same research area so as not to overload any potential faculty mentor in our program. When considered within this system, your application was among the best applications we reviewed.

 

Every year, our program receives a set number of GTAships to distribute among incoming students.  At present, we have sent contracts to that number of applicants and we await their decisions.  Should an offer be declined or should other funding sources emerge, we will extend an invitation to an applicant from our waitlist in accordance with the review system outlined above.  The national deadline for acceptances to funded English graduate programs is April 15th, and we hope to provide all waitlist candidates with a firm decision before that date.

 

Thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to review your work.  Our graduate committee was incredibly impressed with your application, and we hope to you will keep us posted on your continued interest in Oregon State."

For those who will not be going to a program, keep your spirits high and remember that there is no *right* way to be a writer. You are all artists, and not getting into a program is not diagnostic of anything. Keep your spirits high and don't let anything or anyone deter you from your passion and purpose.

I had learned I was waitlisted there maybe a month prior, but only because I called the department to ask. Had I not done that, I would have been completely in the dark until after the national deadline had passed. It seems the department did a poor job this year of communicating with applicants to all of its programs, as other posters had similar experiences applying to the MA and MFA. Were I not fortunate enough to get into a PhD program this year and were I reapplying next year, I would not apply to Miami again."

I emailed ages ago with a question about their application process; I emailed when the April 15 deadline was coming up; I emailed after the April 15 deadline if I wasn't accepted, if I could still get any kind of confirmation.

This may seem a little rant-ish, but I still applied to this school for it's great professors. Clearly, there's some lack of organization and respect within the department. I want future applicants to know this institution may very well be a waste of money (70 dollars to apply!) and time. I can describe them as nothing but highly unprofessional."

Bend is lovely so those who were rejected from the Corvallis campus should consider it (I lived in Corvallis for a year and would probably prefer Bend, just saying). They extended the application date even further so they may not have gotten too many applications this year. If you are in dire straits, you should definitely apply to OSU-Cascades!!! My acceptance e-mail was extremely flattering and I feel a bit bad that I already accepted an offer elsewhere, but I truly don't think the low-residency option is for me, and I've always hoped to continue my education in NYC rather than the west coast, where I've lived all my life.

Some final thoughts: Apply to a variety of programs. Take a chance on programs that are in weird places, younger, and/or up and coming. Don't go $50,000+ in the hole for this degree. Find some place that is either affordable or will at least partially fund you. Only apply where you would actually attend. And realize the subjectivity and inherent unfairness in this process. A lot of this comes down to luck. Don't be so hard on yourself. Life will take you where you're meant to go."

The materials you submitted with your application have been carefully reviewed by the admissions committee, but we are unable to recommend you for admission. The UC Berkeley campus has a strict enrollment ceiling, and we are thus very limited in the number of new students we may admit each year. The admissions committee has the difficult task of selecting students with the strongest overall records from a large pool of well-qualified applicants. Unfortunately, this may result in not being able to accept many applicants who are capable of excellent academic work.

If you do not receive a rejection then I guess you are waitlisted (unofficially) along with myself -- waiting for someone to hopefully reject the offer. This is what I gather after emailing my POI. Indeed, acceptances do run into late March early April because some people are waiting for other offers/ might change their mind for whatever reason. Not sure how applicable this is to other programs, but it seems like the way they go about doing things instead of handing out more offers, like Oxford does, and expect one or two to drop out or not meet the requirements."

Your application has been carefully reviewed by the Graduate Admissions Committee of the English graduate program and by the Office of Graduate Studies. I regret to inform you that your application for graduate study at UC Davis for Fall Quarter 2018 was not approved. Each year, the number of highly qualified applicants far exceeds the available openings in our graduate programs. For this reason, graduate programs must be very selective in making their admission decisions. Each decision is based on a comprehensive review of the applicant's file. Some of the factors taken into consideration include: prior academic record and preparation for advanced study in the selected field; examination scores and other submitted materials; completion of program admissions requirements including prerequisite coursework; ability of the program to provide curricular and/or research opportunities consistent with the applicant's stated educational objectives; and completeness of the applicant's file. The program to which you applied indicated the following as the reason(s) that you were not selected for admission: Academic work is not as competitive as that of other applicants. If you have any questions regarding the reasons for your denial, you may contact the admissions advisor of the English graduate program. Thank you once again for your interest in pursuing graduate education at UC Davis. If in the future you believe that your accomplishments may be competitive, please do not hesitate to reapply. I wish you every success in achieving your educational objectives."""

Cornell University,(English) - Creative Writing Fiction,MFA (F18),Rejected, E-mail,20 Feb 2018,,,,,,,20 Feb 2018,"Dear X,

Your application for admission to the Graduate School at Cornell University has been given careful consideration by the Graduate Field of English Language and Literature. 


I'm very sorry to say that we are unable to offer you admission to our M.F.A. graduate program for Fall 2018.  This was a very difficult decision, since we received hundreds of applications for very few places in the program. We had to turn down a number of very talented people with very impressive records, many of whom no doubt will go on to distinguished careers. 

 
This email will serve as your only notification of your application results.  We appreciate your interest in Cornell, and wish you success in your graduate studies.  Thank you for sharing your work with us.

 
Yours truly,
X

I am sorry to inform you that we are not able to offer you admission to the Brandeis University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Your application was considered by the appropriate department and the credentials you presented were evaluated carefully.The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is small and highly selective, with a limited number of places available in each of its graduate programs. It strives to find the best possible fit between the interests of each applicant and the expertise of our faculty. Each year we find that we must reject a number of excellent students, certainly qualified for graduate study, but who would not find their needed resources at Brandeis. Both the admissions committee and I regret that we are unable to accept a larger number of qualified applicants.

I feel sadder than I'd have thought possible. I do have other offers, but I really really just wanted to go to Brandeis."

02.07.14: Our Admissions Committee considered your application with great care, but I am sorry to inform you that we are not able to offer you admission.

To the person below: ""Guess its another year of unemployed futility""Ã¢ÂÂyes! I'm on the same boat, exciting :D

I have an idea, for the acceptance/rejection letters, like to make them more ethical. Because when I received this one, my heart started beating quickly, and I wasn't able to effectively cut through the rhetoric of it to just find out if I got in or not. Could perhaps committees, instead of writing letters, colour code statuses (green=you're in, red=out), and send out blank pages (idk maybe there's a rule stating that these must be signed and have the name of the addressee, sure, w/e minimal legal (ughh) requirement exists satisfy it) which are either green or red?

But that's a stupid idea, so utopic (not a word, I mean utopia-like, utopiaic...), juvenile, blah blah. The problem is that it would be more effective, it would do nothing more than getting the point across. Efficient, to the point. LOL! And that's precisely why it cannot happen... you know this, the denial of a truth is that which allows for the functioning of society in a first place, the objet a cannot be internalized due to its nonhuman monstrosity, it is inappropriable... joke is this psychoanalytical b/s is TRUE!!!!! and woe to those who are infected with its ideas, good lord jesus, your're %^&*.

I was waitlisted by them back in Feb.  Told I was #3 and was virtually assured to get in.  Subsequently, I received some offers, accepted one well ahead of the deadline, and emailed SC to take me off of their wait list. Emailed was acknowledged with disappointment but appreciation for informing them so promptly.  So why did I get this letter?  Because no one told the grad school that I was no longer a candidate!  I reject this rejection because I already rejected them.  They only  rejected me because no one made it clear that they had been rejected!!! By me! I have accepted a terrific offer from a fine school, and I'm excited to start in the fall. So why does this bother me?  I have no idea.

Like the other poster who noted this same type of issue, I did that and checked many times to be sure all was there. I even talked to the Grad Admissions people twice to make sure all was fine. They assured me they give everything submitted in the Workspace area to the appropriate department. After I got my rejection letter, I thanked them and asked for any ideas on improving my standing. They said I did not submit one required docu*ent. I immediately sent them a note with the correct docu*ent copied from their site and noted that the docu*ent was and is on their site. I didn't hear back so I followed up and asked if I would be reconsidered and was told no, that all decisions are final. I asked if that was so even though they rejected me based on a ""missing"" docu*ent that was there all along. The answer was yes. I had other offers so I am fine but I liked their program and really wanted to go there. Since I see two other posters here with similar stories, my advice to you if you apply there is to send hard copies by registered/certified mail, too, and to make a pest of yourself if you must to be sure that the grad committee does get your materials."

Is anyone deluded enough to want to pay for classes assuming a job, afterward, will appear in the humanities for them to pay off that major debt?
